# Discrete Structure
The concepts and uses of discrete structure in computer science are introduced to the students in this course. Set theory, proving strategies, relations, functions, recurrence relations, counting techniques, graph theory, trees, and finite automata are among the subjects studied in this course. By the end of the course, the student should be able to model electronic devices and issues using deterministic finite automata finite state machines, analyze and solve problems using recurrence relations and counting techniques, apply graph theory and trees to real-world problems, and use set theory, relations, and functions to solve computer science problems.

## Reflection
The discrete structures course strengthened my computer science problem-solving skills through a robust mathematical foundation. I acquired the ability to model electronic devices, address real-world challenges with recurrence relations and graph theory, and developed a keen appreciation for the theoretical aspects of computer science. This knowledge, spanning set theory, proving strategies, relations, functions, recurrence relations, counting techniques, graph theory, trees, and finite automata, is indispensable for success in the dynamic field of computer science.
