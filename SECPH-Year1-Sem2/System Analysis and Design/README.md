# System Analysis and Design
This course provides hands-on experience in systems analysis and design using both structured and object-oriented methodologies. It guides me through planning, analysis, design, and implementation phases to develop system requirements and create prototype interfaces for organizational applications.

## Project: System Enhancement for KADA Operations
This project proposes tailored solutions to improve the operational efficiency of Koperasi Kakitangan Daerah Kelantan Berhad (KADA), focusing on digitizing its member registration and loan application processes. It includes a thorough investigation of current manual workflows, identification of key challenges, and development of a strategic plan—from information gathering and system analysis to interface design and prototyping—to support a modernized and user-friendly application system.

## Reflection
This course deepened my understanding of systems analysis and design through hands-on exposure to both structured and object-oriented methodologies. I gained valuable insights into the full system development life cycle—from planning and analysis to design and implementation. By engaging with real-world scenarios and prototyping exercises, I developed stronger problem-solving, documentation, and interface design skills. Overall, this experience has sharpened my ability to approach system requirements critically and craft effective, user-centered solutions.
